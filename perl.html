<h1>Gerov's Perl Cheat Sheet</h1>

<h2>Scalars</h2>

<pre><code>my $string = "This is a string.";
my $integer = 1;
my $float = 3.14;
</code></pre>

<h3>Single vs Double Quotes</h3>

<pre><code>print "This string\tis \'interpolated\'\n";
print 'This string\tis not \'interpolated\' except for \\ and \\\'\n', "\n";
</code></pre>

<h3>Alternative Delimiters</h3>

<pre><code>print qq/'"Hi," said Jack. "Have you read Slashdot today?"'\n/;
print qq/'"Hi," said Jack. "Have you read \/. today?"'\n/;
print qq|'"Hi," said Jack. "Have you read /. today?"'\n|;
print qq#'"Hi," said Jack. "Have you read /. today?"'\n#;
print qq('"Hi," said Jack. "Have you read /. today?"'\n);
print qq&lt;'"Hi," said Jack. "Have you read /. today?"'\n&gt;;
</code></pre>

<h3>Here-Documents</h3>

<p>EOF can be replaced for whatever</p>

<pre><code>print&lt;&lt;`EOF;

This is a here-document. It starts on the line after the two arrows,
and it ends when the text following the arrows is found at the beginning
of a line, like this:

EOF
</code></pre>

<h3>Standard Input (stdin)</h3>

<pre><code>$line = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
print $line;
</code></pre>

<h2>Lists and Hashes</h2>

<pre><code>print ('one', 2, 'THREE')[0]
</code></pre>

<h3>qw// - quote word</h3>

<p>Similar to a split function - returns a list context</p>

<pre><code>my @array = qw(foo bar       baz);

my $month = qw(
    January    February    March
    April      May         June
    July       August      September
    October    November    December
)[5 - 1];
print "$month is the 5th month.\n";
</code></pre>

<h3>Accessing Multiple Elements</h3>

<pre><code>my @months = (qw(Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec)[3, 5, 7, 9]);`
</code></pre>

<h4>Array Slices</h4>

<pre><code>my @months = qw(Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec);
my @selection = @months[3, 5, 7, 9];
</code></pre>
